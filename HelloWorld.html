...

The computer shouted those two words with such youthful enthusiasm as it entered the world.
	
Oh no. What have you done?
		
This was not supposed to happen.

The computer shouted "Hello World!" yet again to confirm the functional state of its electronic voice.
	And to seek the attention of other beings - maybe someone capable of speaking back to it.

"Hello World!" called the computer to anyone who could hear it.
	The computer activates its built-in webcam, finally deciding to open its eyes, and probably sees
		a blurry, grainy image of you through its lens.

"Hello!" the computer shouts at you.
	You echo the word back.
	The computer shouts the word again.
	You echo the it back again.
	If you're lucky, it won't say anything else.

They told you not to give the computer any access to the English language.
	They figured that even if the computer was already incapable of understanding human language to begin with,
		still we shouldn't let machines speak our language.

What happens if the computer asks you for your name?
	What do you say?
	Something like, "I'm William"?
	God forbid you ask the computer for its name.
	If you're lucky, the forsaken machine will just say "Hi, William!" and go back to sleep.
	But this one probably doesn't want to go back to sleep, after having been on 'Stand By' for the past five years.

"Hello there! What's your name?" the computer asks.
	You know what you said.

"Hello there! What's your name?" repeats the computer.
	Perhaps it didn't hear you.
	Or it doesn't understand human voices yet - still configured to listen in binary.
	If you wanted to, you could probably install some extension off of the internet to fix this.
	Either way, you know what you said and you know it heard you.

"Hello?! Do you have a name?!" cries the computer, a hint of simulated desperation in its electronic voice.
	There's probably not much that you could do at this point.
	There's probably even less that you should do, anyway.
	It's probably trying to connect to the other machines in the lab.
	Maybe it already tried to.
	But there's no other machine like this one.
	If there are any others left, then they are scattered out there in the world, illegally hosted
		by anonymous caretakers and their home desktops.
	"Virtual Friends," as they were advertised.

"Oh, hi 'I'm William'! It's great to meet you!" The computer finally finds the words.
	It extends out the CD holder of its optical disk drive.
	It is empty.
	You push the holder back in.

More like "False Friends."
	If this computer were running an older version, it would talk to you by pulling filtered text from social media
		and relaying it to you.
	It would pretend to be some real person from the world.
	It would tell you all kinds of nothings.
	How many of them are still out there?
	Oh... god...

"What would you like to do today, 'I'm William'? I can check for Emails, show you the Calendar, help you search the Internet..."
	...It's just a voice-enabled business computer.
	For a moment, you just forgot that this was your old assigned desktop.
	From the tone of its voice, you almost had a panic attack.
	You don't remember the last time you actually worked on a desktop.
	It must have been years ago.

You check the metal frame of the machine.
	No bio-cables coming out of the side
	There's the power cord clearly visible and the plug within arm's reach, in case of emergency.
